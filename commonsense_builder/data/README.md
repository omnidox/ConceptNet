# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains essential data files for the ConceptNet-based commonsense knowledge system. The data is organized into three main subdirectories:

## üìÅ paths/
Contains knowledge graph path data and object-location relationships:

- `paths_modified_6.json` (43MB)
  - Core knowledge graph data containing weighted relationships between objects and locations
  - Generated by the modified BFS algorithm in `kg_builder_advanced.py`
  - Used by the robot system for context-aware decision making
  - Format: `{"location:object": [[path_nodes, weight], ...]}` 

- `selected_paths3.txt` (989KB)
  - Curated subset of paths for specific use cases
  - Contains 9,549 validated paths
  - Used for optimization and testing

- `object_locations_avg3.txt` (41MB)
  - Comprehensive mapping of objects to their possible locations
  - Includes averaged weights for location relationships
  - Used for baseline comparisons and validation

## üìÅ results/
Contains analysis and evaluation results:

- `results_comparison.csv` (8.2KB)
  - Comparative analysis of different path selection methods
  - 47 entries comparing various metrics

- `object_context_similarity_scores_2.csv` (48KB)
  - Semantic similarity scores between objects and contexts
  - 452 object-context pairs with their similarity metrics

- `one_to_four_similarity_score_2.csv` (28KB)
  - Analysis of path lengths from 1 to 4 steps
  - 92 entries with comparative scores

- `consistency_results.csv` (1.2KB)
  - System consistency evaluation results
  - 21 test cases with consistency metrics

- `baseline_results.csv` (276B)
  - Baseline performance metrics
  - 12 fundamental test cases

- `ambiguity_analysis.csv` (3.9KB)
  - Analysis of ambiguous object-location relationships
  - 47 cases of ambiguity resolution

- `adaptability_results.csv` (2.5KB)
  - System adaptability test results
  - 32 adaptation scenarios

## üìÅ locations/
Contains location-specific data and mappings used for spatial reasoning and context understanding.

## Usage Notes

1. The `paths_modified_6.json` file is critical for the system's operation and should not be deleted
2. Results files are used for system evaluation and improvement
3. All data files are version controlled and should be updated using the appropriate scripts

## File Generation

- Path data is generated using `kg_builder_advanced.py`
- Results are generated through various analysis scripts in the `src/analysis` directory
- Updates to these files should be documented in the version control system

## Data Maintenance

To maintain data integrity:
1. Always use the provided scripts for data generation
2. Back up the data directory before major updates
3. Verify file integrity after generation using provided validation tools
4. Keep track of file versions and update dates
