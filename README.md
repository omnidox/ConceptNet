## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

1. **Modified BFS for Object-Location Pathfinding:**
```python
def modified_bfs(G, Vobj, Vloc, R, vstart):
    Q = [(vstart, [], {vstart})]
    C = {}
    while Q:
        v, P, Visited = Q.pop(0)
        for r in R:
            Data = fetchRelatedData(v, r, C)
            for edge in Data:
                vnext = process_edge(edge)
                if vnext not in Visited:
                    Visitednew = Visited | {vnext}
                    Pnew = P + [vnext]
                    Q.append((vnext, Pnew, Visitednew))
    return paths
```

2. **Reasoning Process:**
```python
def reasoning_process(V, C):
    R = Detectron2()
    B = BLIP()
    Scsv = scan_context_bins(B)
    for f in V:
        D = detect_objects(f, R)
        for o in D:
            Ko = query_context(o, C)
            if matches_context(Ko, B):
                place_object(o, matched_bin)
```
